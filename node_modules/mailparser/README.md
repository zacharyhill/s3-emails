![Nodemailer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/master/assets/nm_logo_200x136.png)

Advanced email parser for Node.js. Everything is handled as a stream which should make it able to parse even very large messages (100MB+) with relatively low overhead.

See [mailparser homepage](https://nodemailer.com/extras/mailparser/) for documentation and terms.
